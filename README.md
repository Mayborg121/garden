## 🍃 INTRODUCTION
**The Eternal Garden** is an interactive "living letter" designed to transform the pain of distance into a journey of growth. It gamifies the concept of **"Harmony"** across continents. Users must tend to the garden—clearing the mist, unblocking the river, and gathering fireflies—to cultivate enough energy to unlock a final, hidden message of love.

### 🌸 PERSONALIZE THE BLOOM
To target a specific recipient and see their name flourish within the garden, you must inject a **Name Parameter** into the URL string.

| **ACTION** | **INSTRUCTION** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1** | Copy your deployment URL |
| **Step 2** | Append `?n=Name` to the end of the address |

<br>

`mayborg121.github.io/eternal-garden`**`?n=RecipientName`**

`Example : `**`mayborg121.github.io/eternal-garden?n=Soulmate`**

<p>
  <sub><i>The garden will dynamically rewrite its whispers and the final letter to address the specified user.</i></sub>
