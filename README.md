**The Eternal Garden** is a premium, interactive storytelling web experience. Designed to bridge the emotional gap of long-distance relationships, it transforms "distance" into a sensory journey. Users must interact with the environment—clearing fog, moving stones, and gathering fireflies—to unlock a final, heartfelt message.

## 📖 The Narrative
The project serves as a "digital glade." As the user scrolls, they "travel" through 9,999 virtual miles. The journey is divided into interactive stages that symbolize the effort and care required to maintain a deep connection across the globe.

### Interactive Stages:
* **🌫️ The Fog of Distance:** A scratch-off canvas interaction where users manually brush away the "mist" to reveal hidden truths.
* **💎 The Flowing River:** A physics-based interaction where users must clear "stones" to restore the flow of the river.
* **🍃 The Canopy:** A discovery game where users find hidden "Golden Whispers" within a grid.
* **🐦 Flying Together:** A draggable interaction guiding a bird (the spirit) to a bloom.
* **✨ The Grove:** A collection game where fireflies must be gathered to light the final path.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

This project is built with a focus on high-performance animations and glassmorphic UI design.

| Component | Technology | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Engine** | **GSAP 3** | Handles all scroll-driven timelines, Draggable events, and state-based transitions. |
| **Styling** | **Tailwind CSS** | Powers the glassmorphism, responsive grids, and elegant typography. |
| **Graphics** | **HTML5 Canvas** | Used for the procedural background mist and the destination-out "scratch" effect. |
| **Typography** | **Google Fonts** | Features *Playfair Display* for elegance and *Montserrat* for modern readability. |
| **State** | **Vanilla JS** | A lightweight state object tracks "Harmony Level" to unlock gated content. |

## 🚀 Unique Features

* **Harmony Lock:** The final letter is cryptographically "locked" behind a 100% Harmony requirement. Users must complete all mini-games to see the message.
* **Dynamic Personalization:** The site accepts a name parameter in the URL (e.g., `index.html?n=Alex`) to personalize the entire experience for the recipient.
* **Parallax Environment:** Multiple fixed layers and particle systems (falling leaves/petals) create an immersive 3D feel.
* **Scroll-to-Distance Mapping:** The "Miles from your Soul" counter is mathematically mapped to the vertical scroll progress.
